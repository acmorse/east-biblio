This is the final portion of my study of the Nyāyamukha. It took me ten years to finish editing and translating this small but difficult work. On this occasion I would like to thank those who have sent me their comments on and corrections of my translations and notes. I promise to publish a revised English version in the future. Meanwhile, I would like to work on what Prof. M. Hahn calls 'working edition' of the Pramāṇasamuccaya-vṛtti and Ṭīkā, as well as to translate the portions of the Pramāṇasamuccaya-vṛtti which have not been touched by Profs. Hattori and Kitagawa. I originally intended to evaluate Dignāga's logical system by using modern symbolic logic. However, my interest on that area has somehow decreased and I will expect someone to take over that task.</abstract>
